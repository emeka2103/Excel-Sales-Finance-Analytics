### Sales Analytics  
I performed a thorough examination of net sales performance, conducting a comprehensive analysis that encompassed multiple dimensions such as year, customer, market, product, growth, and division. The objective of sales analytics is to enable businesses to systematically observe and assess their sales overall performance.

### Finance Analytics
I devised and put into action critical financial metrics, including Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, and Gross Margin Percentage, with the aim of constructing a Profit and Loss (P&L) statement. These metrics play a crucial role in producing valuable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes.
